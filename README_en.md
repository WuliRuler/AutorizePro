# üßø AutorizePro (AI Analysis Module is Live ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•):  
### One-Sentence Introduction: AutorizePro is an innovative Burp plugin with a built-in AI analysis module, specialized in authorization bypass detection. (Don‚Äôt forget to give it a star üåü)

> **üü£Ô∏è When the AI feature is disabled, it uses the standard detection logic. AI analysis is optional but highly recommended. Due to the diverse nature of API responses, rule-based logic often falls short. Enabling AI analysis significantly improves efficiency and accuracy. Time is precious, so let AI handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks. Start discovering vulnerabilities at ten times the speed!**

### Tool Background
- **Authorization bypass vulnerabilities are almost mandatory checks during black-box testing and SRC investigations, but manual testing for these vulnerabilities can be extremely time-consuming.**
- **Automated tools, on the other hand, often suffer from high false positives due to the diverse nature of APIs. This gap led to the development of an AI-assisted analysis tool ‚û°Ô∏è AutorizePro !! ‚¨ÖÔ∏è**

### Tool Highlights
- **Optimized detection logic && added optional AI analysis module, reducing false-positive rates from 99% to 5%, liberating you from the sea of false positives.**
- **For alerts that require manual confirmation, the tool provides a comparison view of the original request, unauthorized request, and authorization bypass attempt, making it easy to spot differences.**
- **Supports various customizable options, including filter configurations, replacement rules, report exports, and integration with multiple large language models (defaulting to the outstanding Tongyi Qianwen).**

## üîß Installing AutorizePro
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download Burp Suite and Jython

    1. Download Burp Suite: https://portswigger.net/burp/releases
    2. Download the Jython standalone JAR file: https://www.jython.org/download.html

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Burp Suite‚Äôs Python Environment

	1. Open Burp Suite.
	2. Navigate to Extender -> Options.
	3. In the Python Environment section, click Select File.
	4. Choose the Jython standalone JAR file you just downloaded (This project tests the env is: jython 2.7.3, java1.8, burp suite 2024.9).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install the AutorizePro Plugin
	1. Download the latest release ZIP package from the code repository, extract it locally.
    2. Open Burp Suite, navigate to Extender -> Extensions -> Add.
    3. In the Extension Type dropdown, select python.
    4. In the Extension File field, choose the path to the `AutorizePro.py` file from the repository.

## üî´ Using the AutorizePro Plugin
    1. Open the configuration tab by clicking AutorizePro -> Configuration.

    2. Use the `fetch cookie header` button to fetch the latest authentication header from the request or manually copy the low-privileged user's authentication header (usually Cookie or Authorization), then paste it into the textbox labeled ‚ÄúInsert injected header here.‚Äù Note: If the request already contains the header, the plugin will replace it; otherwise, a new header will be added.

    3. If you don‚Äôt need to test unauthenticated requests (i.e., requests without any cookies to check if the endpoint requires authentication), you can uncheck the `Check unauthenticated` box (enabled by default).

    4. Enable the `Intercept requests from Repeater` checkbox to process requests sent from Repeater with the plugin.

    5. Click the `AutorizePro is off` button to enable the plugin, allowing AutorizePro to start intercepting traffic and performing authorization checks.

    6. Open your browser and configure proxy settings to direct traffic through Burp's proxy.

    7. Use a high-privileged user account to access the application you want to test. When modifying resources for the privilege escalation test, you can use the Match/Replace configuration to modify the resource information needed for the test.

    8. In the left-side results panel of the AutorizePro plugin, you will see the URL of the request and the corresponding privilege check status.

    9. Currently, only the Aliyun Tongyi Qianwen API key (starting with `sk`) is supported. How to obtain the API key: https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/get-api-key.

    10. When the API key is enabled, requests that meet the AI analysis trigger conditions will be further analyzed by AI, and results will be displayed in the `AI Analyzer` column.

    11. By clicking a URL in the left-side results panel, you can view its original request, modified request, and unauthenticated request/response to help distinguish differences.

### üå† Example Usage Effect
> üåü Drastically reduced false positives: As seen in the image below, after enabling AI analysis, you only need to analyze whether a request is truly unauthorized, saving over 95% of manual analysis effort.

> ‚¨áÔ∏è Test privilege escalation by replacing cookies

> ‚¨áÔ∏è Test privilege escalation by replacing parameters

> View the specific request determined by AI to be unauthorized, and simultaneously display the unauthorized request, original request, and unauthenticated request to easily compare differences.

### ‚ùì Status Explanation
- **Bypassed! (Red) : Unauthorized Access Detected**
- **Enforced! (Green) : No Unauthorized Access Detected**
- **Is enforced??? (please configure enforcement detector): Cannot Determine, Configure Enforcement Detector for Assistance**

```angular2html
TIPS:
The `Is enforced???` status means the plugin cannot determine if the endpoint is enforcing authorization. You can configure the enforcement detector with specific authorization characteristics to assist in judgment.

Example:
If a particular endpoint responds with ‚ÄúUnauthorized‚Äù for privilege escalation attempts, you can add this fingerprint to the Enforcement Detector filter. This way, the plugin will look for this characteristic when judging if authorization is enforced, reducing false positives.
```

### üö∞ Filter Configuration: Set Interception Rules in Interception Filters

- You can configure which domains or which requests the plugin should intercept.
- Filters can be based on blacklists, whitelists, regular expressions, or Burp‚Äôs scope settings, preventing unnecessary domains from being intercepted, reducing irrelevant request analysis.
- üåü The default configuration avoids intercepting scripts and images, but you can add more static resource types to the ignore list.

## üí∞ How Much Does the AI Analysis Feature Cost? (By default, detection logic is followed, and AI is only activated when enabled by the user)
- To minimize the costs associated with AI analysis, only packets with equal status codes, JSON format responses, and lengths under 3000 are analyzed when AI analysis is enabled. If conditions are not met, AI analysis will not activate.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: When enabling AI analysis, you should configure the intercepted domains/rules in Interception Filters to avoid cost overruns caused by analyzing irrelevant sites.
- Personal testing cost example: during high-frequency testing throughout a full day without domain restrictions, the total cost was **¬•0.38** (tongyi qwen-plus).
